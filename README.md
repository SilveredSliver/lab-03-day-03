lab-03-day-03 extended 'about me' project

As a developer, I want to create console.log(); notifications so that other developers can keep track of user input as making sure that the code is running smoothly and how it should be. I want to be able to write code that other developers can read easily.

As a user, I want the questions to be clear and easy to provide a response to.
